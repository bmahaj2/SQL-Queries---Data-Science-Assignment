If classes can belong to more than one area (e.g., it can be both a theory and systems class), we need to break the table Dim_type into three tables to remove 
redundancy. 

For example consider the Dim_Type table with the following entries.

ID		Type			Area 
1		Course			ai
2		Seminar			Systems
2		Seminar			Theory	
3 		Independent_Study       ai

So here in the above table for ID=2 type is seminar and Area is both systems and Theory. So there is redundancy in the table. So to remove redundancy we divide it
into 3 three tables as follows

ID		Type			                    ID	         Area                                                  Type_ID       Area_ID
1		Course			  	            10           ai                                                       1		10
2		Seminar			 	            20           Systems                                                  2  		20
2		Seminar				            30	         Theory						          2		30
3 		Independent_Study                                                                                                 3             10


So we get Three relations

Dim_Type1(
ID int,
Type text
)


Dim_Area(
ID int,
Area text
)


Type_area(
Type_ID int,
Area_ID int
)
